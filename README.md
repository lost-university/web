## Stefi

- [ ] Label of selected modules in graph different color
- [ ] Popover on node click (select/unselect and adunis)
- [ ] Maybe position selected modules differently in graph
- [ ] Maybe style nodes differently. Rounded square with text, like planner?
- [ ] Spread nodes, so no nodes, labels or edges overlap in weird way
- [ ] Maybe get edges to not overlap when connecting to node (confusing)
